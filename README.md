# Trivia Game
This project utilizes a Trivia API (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to generate questions for the user to answer. Additional CSS was provided by CodePen user Kirsten Allen (https://codepen.io/kirstenallen/pen/MWwPYYm). Users can select from multiple categories to generate a new API call that populates with relevant trivia content.

Project is at MVP status. Post-MVP goals:

1. Fix minor bugs effecting the flow of the game that do not affect MVP.
2. Add "hard mode" where users can enter their answer directly via form.
